Here's a brief overview of some of the common array methods in JavaScript:

_find()_: This method returns the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array until the condition is satisfied. If no element is found, it returns _undefined_.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const firstEvenNumber = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(firstEvenNumber); // 2
```

_findIndex()_: This method returns the index of the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array until the condition is satisfied. If no element is found, it returns _-1_

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const firstEvenNumberIndex = numbers.findIndex((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(firstEvenNumberIndex); // 1
```

_filter()_: This method creates a new array with all elements that pass a given condition. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. If the condition is satisfied, the element is included in the new array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
```

_slice()_: This method creates a new array by copying a portion of an existing array. It takes two arguments, start and end, which specify the starting and ending indices of the portion to be copied. The original array is not modified.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const middleNumbers = numbers.slice(1, 4);
console.log(middleNumbers); // [2, 3, 4]
```

_splice()_: This method modifies an array by removing or replacing existing elements, or by adding new elements. It takes at least two arguments, start and deleteCount, which specify the starting index and the number of elements to delete. Additional arguments can be used to specify elements to be added to the array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.splice(1, 3, 6, 7);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 6, 7, 5]
```

_concat()_: This method creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays. It does not modify the original arrays.

```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const concatenatedArray = array1.concat(array2);
console.log(concatenatedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

_push()_: This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. It modifies the original array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const newLength = numbers.push(4, 5, 6);
console.log(newLength); // 6
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

_map()_: This method creates a new array by calling a callback function for each element in an array. The callback function can transform the element in some way, and the transformed elements are included in the new array. The original array is not modified.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
```

_reduce()_: This method applies a callback function to each element in an array, in order to reduce the array to a single value. The callback function takes two arguments, accumulator and currentValue, and returns a single value that is used as the accumulator in the next iteration.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
```

_copyWithin()_: This method copies elements within an array to a different position in the same array. It takes two arguments, target and start, which specify the starting index and the ending index of the portion to be copied. The copied elements overwrite the existing elements at the target index.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.copyWithin(0, 3);
console.log(numbers); // [4, 5, 3, 4, 5]
```
